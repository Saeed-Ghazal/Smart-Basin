We participated in **IEEE Pitchinno 2025** with an innovative Smart Basin designed to monitor and optimize agricultural conditions using AI and IoT.

The Smart Basin allows users to control water levels, lighting (RGB LEDs), and monitor environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, sunlight) via a **remote control mobile application**.

## Features

- Remote control via mobile application to adjust water pump and LED lights.
- Real-time monitoring of water level, temperature, humidity, and sunlight.
- Automatic control modes for water and lighting based on sensor readings.
- Customizable RGB lighting through color picker.
- Safety features to prevent overfilling or drying of the basin.
